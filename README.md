Customer segmentation analysis can help make your business strategy more effective.



These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona or product user persona. This is because effective customer segmentation analysis is typically used to inform a brandâ€™s messaging and positioning, helps organisations know what new products are services they might want to invest in, and uncovers ways to improve how the business sells. Because of this, marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those segments in order to be effective.
